# Pluralsight: Azure Service Fabric Programming Models

This repository contains sample code for my Pluralsight course [Understanding the Programming Models of Azure Service Fabric](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-service-fabric-programming-models/table-of-contents)

See appropriate folder for each module's complete code (M4, M5 etc.).

Updated course is only using `.NET Core` as opposed to the old course that was using `.NET Framework`. Plese consider using .NET Core for all of your project as .NET Framework gets supported less and less, and some of SF features are not in .NET Framework anymore.

This contains sample code for reliable services (stateful and stateless), asp.net core web api, actors, deployment scripts, azure pipelines samples, and even Docker containers.

> Please raise a GitHub issue here if you have any issues in code, or comment directly on Pluralsight, so I can update the course if there are any issues.
